# class-ressources

## Labs

Contains non mandatory activities. In the current state, one can browse them to see what they are about, then find better and more complete equivalent tutorials online, for instance on the official [ROS documentation website](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials.html). 

## Assignements

Contains mandatory work assignments, for which deadline and conditions apply and will be communicated in class.

## Whiteboards

Contains tldraw whiteboards presented in class, so you don't have to do photos anymore. To visualize them, use the tldraw extension of VSCode. I wish there was another way, but it doesn't seem to be the case yet.
